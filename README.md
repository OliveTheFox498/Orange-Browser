# The Orange Browser

The Orange Browser is an experimental web browser built around three core ideas:

- **Style** — the interface should feel intentional, calm, and pleasant to exist in  
- **Comfort** — browsing shouldn’t feel loud, cluttered, or stressful  
- **Privacy** — no tracking goals, no data harvesting ambitions, no hidden motives  

This project exists because modern browsers tend to optimize for everything *except* how it feels to actually use them.

That said — this is **very early software**.

## Important Disclaimer

The Orange Browser is currently **extremely minimal** and **not intended for regular use**.

You should **not download or rely on this browser** unless:
- You are curious about the concept
- You are comfortable running experimental software
- You understand that features, behavior, and stability may change without notice

At this stage, Reverie is closer to a **design and architectural prototype** than a finished product.

## Current State

Right now, the Orage Browser:
- Has a minimal feature set  
- Lacks many things you would expect from a daily-driver browser  
- May contain bugs, missing safeguards, or unfinished behavior  

This repository is public for transparency, learning, and future collaboration — not because the browser is production-ready.

## Why This Exists

The Orange Browser is an attempt to explore what a browser could feel like if it prioritized:
- Stylish design
- User comfort
- Privacy

There is no roadmap promise yet. Things will evolve slowly and intentionally.

## Contributing

If you’re interested in the idea more than the current implementation, feel free to:
- Read the code
- Open discussions
- Share thoughts or design feedback  

Please understand that contributions may be selective while the foundation is still being shaped.
